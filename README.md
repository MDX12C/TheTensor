First, we need a directory named "build". It will be the place that we build executive files.
Second, we need a directory named "log". In the directory is a file named "log_00.txt" also be filled of two '0' with no any other character.
Third, we need a directory named "datas". It will be the place that we store datas. Forth, "CONSTRUCT" and "DESTRUCT" need be place in the front of and in the back of every main function.
In the end, you can use "FileMaker.sh" to build your executive files and run your files in directory "build".
Also, some file will stop running when the file to open isn't exist.
However, please remind that the "Float16" is not usible now.
